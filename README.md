#Fibonacci

In order to test this, please run "node fibonacci.js" in the terminal. NodeJS must be installed on the machine where the script is run.

#shopping-basket

The application was made with create-react-app and have also included redux to manage the component states.
In order to run the application, clone the folder and generate the node modules that will also include the large React library folders.
After generating the files, simply run npm start/yarn start in the directory of the application.
Please ensure that all the dependencies from 'package.json' are installed before running the application.

Notes:

 - Full implementation with the functionality/features of the shopping basket has been made, but UI needs a lot of work(required buttons need to be added and layout/positions fixes need to be made e.g. collection gallery items to be lined up on a single row).
 - In order to add/remove items from the basket, click on the left and right arrows which have the remove/add actions.
 - Extra: you can remove an item, irrespective of its quantity, by clicking on the far-right X button.
